const char ToolHelpDescription[] =
    R"a(This tool parses a given C++ source file and outputs relevant definitions
for a list of provided struct names. It finds the definitions for each struct
given by the names provided, as well as any nested structs or types that they
depend on.

This tool is intended to be used to parse the NVIDIA driver source code; as
such, there are some assumptions made about how structs are defined and what
types are used.

To parse structs defined in multiple files, it is easier to create a C++ file
that includes all the files to be parsed. You will also need a
compile_commands.json file that contains a compile command with the relevant
include directories.

The struct names should be specified in a JSON file containing a JSON object,
which has a "structs" key that maps to a list of strings. The tool will search
for the struct definition in the given source files, and output the struct
definition to the specified output file.

This output file will contain a JSON object with a "records" (structs or unions)
field mapping each name to its definition, as well as an "aliases" field for
any aliases that were found. A variety of information is outputted:
- For records, the fields are given as a JSON array of objects with "name",
  "type", and "offset" keys. The record also has a "size" key indicating the
  size of the struct in bytes, an "is_union" key indicating whether it is a
  union or not, and a "source" key containing the file name and line number
  where it was defined.
- For aliases, the type is given as a JSON object with a "type" and "size" key

Example usage:
    driver_ast_parser --structs=structs.json -o=output.json driver_source_files.h

structs.json:
    {
        "structs": [
            "TestStruct",
            "TestStruct2"
        ]
    }
)a";
